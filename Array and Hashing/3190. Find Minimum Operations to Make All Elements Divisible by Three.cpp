    Time Complexity: O(1)
    Space Complexity: O(1)

Analysis:

Outer Loop: The for loop runs for each element in the nums vector, which has a time complexity of O(N)

Inner While Loops: For each element that is not divisible by 3, the code runs two while loops to find the nearest multiple of 3 by either incrementing or decrementing the value. In the worst case, each while loop can run up to 2 iterations (since the maximum distance to the nearest multiple of 3 is 2). Therefore, the time complexity for the inner loops is O(1)
 for each element.
Combining these, the overall time complexity is:
    O(N)Ã—O(1)=O(N)
So, the time complexity of your code is O(N),
